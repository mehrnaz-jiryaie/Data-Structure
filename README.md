# Data Structure and Algorithm Implementations in Python

Welcome to my repository! 🎯  
This project contains simple and well-known implementations of fundamental data structure and algorithm problems using **Python**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is built as a learning and practice resource for:
- Strengthening understanding of algorithms
- Preparing for coding interviews and technical assessments
- Providing clean and minimal Python implementations of classic problems

## 🗂️ Algorithms Implemented So Far

| Algorithm         | Description                       | File               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Fibonacci         | Calculates nth term of the Fibonacci sequence | `fibonacci.ipynb`     |
| Linear Search     | Searches for a value in a list one by one     | `linear_search.ipynb` |

More algorithms will be added over time.
